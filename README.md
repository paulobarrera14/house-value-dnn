# Deep Neural Network for Housing Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This project develops a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model to predict housing prices based on a variety of features, such as location, size, number of bedrooms, age of the property, and more. Utilizing a dataset of historical housing transactions, this model aims to capture complex, non-linear relationships between the features and the house price, providing accurate predictions that can aid in real estate analysis and decision-making.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/housing-price-prediction.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd housing-price-prediction

3. Install the required dependencies (When we have a requirments.txt with the dependencies we need):

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical housing prices along with various features that potentially affect those prices. Each row represents a single housing transaction with the following features:
